# Fintech Case Study: Shopify Inc.

## Author: Jonathan Koblik

### Overview and Origin

Shopify Inc. is a groundbreaking Canadian e-commerce success story, founded in Ottawa, Canada, in 2006. Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake initially tried to launch an online store selling snowboarding equipment called Snowdevil in 2004, however, 2 years later they launched a revised platform which gave way to the existing name of Shopify. Shopify is an e-commerce platorm for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems, offering an array of services providing turn-key solutions to its online merchants.
The company received $7 million from an initial series A round of venture capital financing in December 2010. The next, a Series B round, raised $15 million in October 2011. The company then received an additional $100 million in Series C funding in December 2013.
Shopify went public on May 21, 2015, and in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, started trading at $28, more than 60% higher than its US$17 offering price, with its IPO raising more than $131 million.

The company (SHOP.TO) currently has a share price of $1,233.88 CAD, with a market cap of $143.3B CAD.

### Business Activities

Shopify is an all-inclusive online selling platform and wants to make hosting an e-commerce store seamless and affordable, with a very transparent payment structure. This can aid retailers in transitioning from the ever-failing brick and mortar approach and enter the new standard of selling online. At their point of launch, the existing e-commerce platforms weren't as user friendly, comprehensive and transparent in their payment structures. Shopify is essentially a one-stop-shop for helping get a business from having zero online presence to becoming ready to sell in a very short time. They handle payments, marketing, shopping and customer engagement tools - the spectrum of services is spectacular. 

It's target customer base is essential small companies. In reality, their platforms ease of use has made it a popular choice for anyone who would like to make their business come alive online. They have had over 1 million businesses use their platform to build their online business. According to Statscan, there are almost 1.1 million SMEs in Canada. More than half (55%) have fewer than 4 employees, and only 1.6% are medium-sized businesses. Small businesses employed almost 69.7% of private sector workers in 2012, or 7.7 million people across the country. Considering the statistics of the market potential in Canada alone, it's considerable. When one considers the larger markets in which they operate in, i.e. the United States, the potential is enormous.

Shopify offers online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping and customer engagement tools to simplify the process of running an online store for small merchants. For one monthly rate, you can create and develop an online store that you can use to promote, sell, and ship your products. Shopify is popular due to its low startup cost and easy-to-use interface. It’s possible to run a complete online store for as little as $29/month, which relative to other competitors is quite good given the wide array of services, features and overall support included. 
Shopify's founder, Tobias Lütke, was a computer programmer by trade and use the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails framework. It uses an application programming interface (API) platform as well as cloud-based SaaS.
Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts. Liquid has been in production use at Shopify since 2006 and is now used by many other hosted web applications.

### Landscape

Shopify Inc. is a. e-commerce technology company which provides a cloud-based multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. They are extremely innovative and are at the cutting edge of technological innovations in this field. 
Over the past 5 years Shopify (SHOP.TO) has gone from an IPO of $17 CAD per share to its current price of $1,233.88 CA. The technology sector has been performing extraordinarily well over the past 5 and even 10 years. During the COVID-19 crisis this industry has almost single handedly raised the entire stock markets valuation. Other major tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, often referred to as the FAANGs, have all changed the world with their revolutionary products and services, with disruptive technology constantly changing the landscape of business and daily life altogether. This is now ubiquitously known as the industry of the future.
Taking a look at the competitive landscape related to Shopify in particular, Shopify's top 15 competitors are Magento, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, Volusion, PrestaShop, 3dcart, Big Cartel, Shopline, AmeriCommerce, OpenText, Orckestra and WebLinc.
Simply put, Shopify is an easy to use platform geared towards novice users. Other competitors are often cutting out and targeting niche segments of the vast e-commerce market. For instance, Magento offers more advanced features for experienced business owners. Wix is a free website builder, but lacks more comprehensive service offerings. Shopify has carved out what could arguably be the most all-encompassing segment of the market, allowing them to cast a broader net.
A massive piece of news released in summer 2020 indicated that Shopify has just become Walmart’s first-ever commerce platform partner, helping businesses reach shoppers and grow sales. Walmart is a massive retailer and this partnership firmly secures Shopify's stance as a major competitor for years to come.
The single biggest shockwave in this industry is the e-commerce explosion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The stay-at-home economy has proliferated and businesses in this sector are all reaping the large benefits.

Various indicators of success are examined when it comes to this industry, some being businesses/users of their platform, revenue for the company and revenue generated by businesses using their services, strategic partnerships and share price. Another interesting metric used is how often they are searched on Google.
By comparison, Magento, a major competitor, only had 100,000 online stores created using its platform. Shopify has an order of magnitude more customers - over 1 million. $155 billion USD worth of goods have been sold through Magento-based systems in 2019, compared to $319 billion USD for Shopify.
In terms of the search volume on Google, Shopify has a whopping 2.6 million. The next most are WooCommerce with 450k and Magento with 355k, respectively.

### Recommendations

In my opinion, I have two services which I would recommend for Shopify, Inc. 
The first is that they partner with a financing company to allow for businesses to leverage their product selling capabilities, which would also bolster overall activity on their platform. People need financing to run their business and so it would only make sense to have a strategic partner to aid them in the process.
They currently have many partners for payment methods, but they lack the lending side of the equation.
This brings me to the second recommended service - a strategic partner or even a proprietary service to help people actually incorporate their business. This, of course, would have to vary depending on the country, however, fills in a missing key to the link in actually making these online merchants bring their business to life. In Canada, for example, I recommend they either create their own version of or partner with - Ownr. It's an online quick, easy and cheap service for Canadians to register their company hassle-free. They have a financial partnership with RBC. Maybe all 3 could work together to help build synergy.
Tech involved would vary depending on whether it's simply partnering with company who already specializes in this area or if Shopify would actually be developing these services in-house. Considering the company is considered a 'one-stop-shop', adding financing and business registration options create even less barriers for potential customers to run their online business using Shopify's platform and will certainly help them stand out even more as the most favourable choice amoung its competitition.
